A backend for the Âµg Project's network location provider that uses local GSM data to resolve user location. See [https://github.com/microg]

A facility in the setting menu allows you to create a database using data from [http://opencellid.org OpenCellId] and/or [https://location.services.mozilla.com Mozilla Location Services] CSV files. Alternatively, the on-phone database can be generated in advance via the [https://github.com/n76/lacells-creator lacells-creator] scripts that gather tower information from those two sources, too.

You can improve the quality of the data used by this location provider by contributing to either or both of those projects.

This backend performs no network data to resolve locations, no queries are made to a centralized AP location provider.
